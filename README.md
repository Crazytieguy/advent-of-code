# [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/)

When solving the problems I focused on:

* Reaching a working solution as quickly as possible
* Never giving up or looking up the solution (The closest I got was 2022 day 16, after 10 hours)
* After submitting a correct solution, refactoring
* Reading other solutions to learn about algorithms or patterns I don't know
* Applying everything to create the most beautiful and efficient solution I can

As far as I can tell from browsing the solution megathreads on [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/), I have the most efficient solution for most of the 2022 problems.
