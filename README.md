# [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/)

This is one of my favorite settings for honing my programming skills. In addition to enjoying the challenge and never looking up the answer, each year I had a specific focus:
* In 2021 I focused on learning Rust.
* In 2022 I focused on optimizing my solutions until they are faster than any other solution I know of (see [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/)).
* In 2023 I focused on solving the problems quickly and having very good error handling.

Some solutions I'm especially proud of:
* [2022 day 16](https://github.com/Crazytieguy/advent-of-code/blob/master/2022/src/bin/day16/main.rs), which forced me to find and implement an algorithm that would be efficient enough (branch and bound). It took me 10 hours and was the closest I got to giving up on a problem.
* [2022 day 20](https://github.com/Crazytieguy/advent-of-code/blob/master/2022/src/bin/day20/main.rs), for which I invented a linked list where each node points to some generic number of steps after it and 1 step behind it.
* [2022 day 23](https://github.com/Crazytieguy/advent-of-code/blob/master/2022/src/bin/day23/main.rs), where I learned to work with SIMD, and came up with some ideas that later went into my work on lending iterators.
* [2023 day 25](https://github.com/Crazytieguy/advent-of-code/blob/master/2023/python/day25/main.py), where I didn't know the classical way of solving it (max-flow/min-cut), and invented a different algorithm that was tailored to this problem and turned out to have the same complexity.
