As far as I can tell from browsing the solution megathreads on [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/), I have the most efficient solution for most of the 2022 problems.

Solutions I'm especially proud of:
* [2022 day 16](https://github.com/Crazytieguy/advent-of-code/blob/master/2022/src/bin/day16/main.rs), which forced me to find and implement an algorithm that would be efficient enough (branch and bound). It took me 10 hours and was the closest I got to giving up on a problem.
* [2022 day 20](https://github.com/Crazytieguy/advent-of-code/blob/master/2022/src/bin/day20/main.rs), for which I invented a linked list where each node points to some generic number of steps after it and 1 step behind it.
* [2022 day 23](https://github.com/Crazytieguy/advent-of-code/blob/master/2022/src/bin/day23/main.rs), where I learned to work with SIMD, and came up with some ideas that later went into my work on lending iterators.

When solving the problems I focused on:

* Reaching a working solution as quickly as possible
* Never giving up or looking up the solution
* After submitting a correct solution, refactoring
* Reading other solutions to learn about algorithms or patterns I don't know
* Applying everything to create the most beautiful and efficient solution I can
